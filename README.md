Joint Action and the Emergence of Mindreading
=============================================

Stephen A. Butterfill

Nothing here is written for public viewing; unless you are at the workshop it won't make much sense.  I do have a couple of papers on this topic, however:

- ["Joint Action and Development"](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/philosophy/people/faculty/butterfill/joint_action_0.93.pdf) (forthcoming, Philosophical Quarterly)
- ["What Is Joint Action?  A modestly deflationary account"](http://butterfill.com/what_is_joint_action) (submitted)

This is very provisional; lots will change before the workshop.

The draft slides are the file "joint action mindreading paris.pptx.pdf"
(You could also try the pptx file, but it is unlikely to render properly because it depends on fonts etc.)

The draft handout is "joint actions and mindreading paris HANDOUT.pdf".

Comments are very welcome, as always.
