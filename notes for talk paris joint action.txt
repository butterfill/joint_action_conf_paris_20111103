Paris Joint Action talk

- handwritten notes don't nicely correspond to what I said.
- slides are most closely based on Tuebingen talk (with updates from What Is Joint Action? the paper on collective goals
- the handout and slides have progress on shared goals not documented anywhere else ('most wants')
- particularly the third part, on joint action & knowing others minds, comes from Tuebingen
